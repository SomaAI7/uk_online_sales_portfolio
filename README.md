# UK Online Sales Analyis
## Project Background
In this project, we analyzed a UK-based online retail dataset to uncover meaningful business insights. The company primarily sells home goods, gifts, and lifestyle products. While the majority of its transactions occur within the UK, it also serves international customers on a smaller scale. Key business metrics include revenue, quantity sold and customer location. We acquired one year of data spanning from December 2010 to December 2011.
### We aim to answer the following business questions:
-	Which individual products and product categories generate the highest revenue and quantity sold across the entire dataset?-
-	Are there noticeable monthly or seasonal patterns in customer purchasing behavior throughout the year?
-	Which countries or regions contribute the most to total revenue, and how does revenue distribution vary across locations?
### Insights and recommendations are organized around the following key areas:
-	Top-performing categories and products
-	Monthly and seasonal sales trends
-	Regional sales performance
